## 📴 Running Fully Offline (No Database)

This project has been configured to work in **offline mode** using in-memory storage instead of PostgreSQL.

This means:

* ✅ Works completely on local PC
* ⚠️ Chats reset when server restarts (RAM storage)

   (WhatsApp → Chat → Export Chat → Without Media)
2. Open the app in browser
3. Upload the `.txt` file
4. Click **"Parse & View Chat"**
5. View formatted chat interface instantly 🎉

## ⚙️ Environment Variables (Optional)

Not required for offline mode.

If using a real database (advanced):
Create a `.env` file:

```
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
PORT=5000
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: `'NODE_ENV' is not recognized`

Fix (Windows):
Update `package.json`:

```
"dev": "set NODE_ENV=development && tsx server/index.ts"
```

---

### Issue: Chat Not Found

Cause: In-memory storage resets on server restart.
Solution: Re-upload the chat file after restarting the server.

---

### Issue: Port Already in Use

Change port in `server/index.ts`:

```
const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;
```

Or kill the running process on port 5000.
